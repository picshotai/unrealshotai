# Credit System Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the credit system in this boilerplate. This documentation covers everything you need to know to understand, implement, and manage the credit system effectively.

## üìö Documentation Overview

This documentation is organized into three main sections:

### 1. [Credit System Architecture](./CREDIT_SYSTEM.md)
**Essential reading for understanding the system**
- System architecture and components
- Database schema and relationships
- Core services (CreditService, CreditManager)
- Real-time updates with Supabase
- Payment integration with DodoPayments
- Security and best practices
- Troubleshooting guiide.

### 2. [Credit Utilities & Configuration](./CREDIT_UTILITIES.md)
**Advanced utilities and system configuration**
- Credit validation and formatting utilities
- Calculation and pricing helpers
- Backup and recovery procedures
- Environment variables and configuration
- Analytics and monitoring
- Performance optimization
- Scaling strategies

### 3. [Integration Guide & Examples](./CREDIT_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md)
**Practical implementation examples**
- Quick start integration patterns
- Tool integration examples (AI, image processing)
- UI component patterns
- API integration patterns
- Payment flow integration
- Admin panel integration
- Mobile app considerations

## üöÄ Quick Start

If you're new to this system, follow this recommended reading order:

1. **Start Here**: Read the [System Architecture](./CREDIT_SYSTEM.md#architecture-overview) section
2. **Database Setup**: Follow the [Database Schema](./CREDIT_SYSTEM.md#database-schema) guide
3. **Basic Integration**: Check the [Quick Start Integration](./CREDIT_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md#quick-start-integration) examples
4. **Advanced Features**: Explore [Credit Utilities](./CREDIT_UTILITIES.md) for advanced functionality

## üîß Common Use Cases

### For Developers
- **Adding a new tool**: See [Tool Integration Examples](./CREDIT_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md#tool-integration-examples)
- **Custom UI components**: Check [UI Component Patterns](./CREDIT_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md#ui-component-patterns)
- **API endpoints**: Review [API Integration Patterns](./CREDIT_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md#api-integration-patterns)

### For System Administrators
- **Configuration**: Review [Environment Variables](./CREDIT_UTILITIES.md#environment-variables)
- **Monitoring**: Set up [Analytics](./CREDIT_UTILITIES.md#analytics-and-monitoring)
- **Scaling**: Plan with [Scaling Strategies](./CREDIT_UTILITIES.md#scaling-strategies)

### For Business Owners
- **Pricing strategy**: Use [Credit Calculation](./CREDIT_UTILITIES.md#credit-calculation-utilities)
- **Payment integration**: Configure [Payment Systems](./CREDIT_SYSTEM.md#payment-integration)
- **User management**: Implement [Admin Features](./CREDIT_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md#admin-panel-integration)

## üèóÔ∏è System Components

### Core Services
- **CreditService**: Basic credit operations (add, deduct, check)
- **CreditManager**: Real-time updates and event management
- **Payment Integration**: DodoPayments integration for purchases
- **Analytics**: Usage tracking and reporting

### Database Tables
- `user_credits`: Current credit balances
- `credit_transactions`: Transaction history
- `credit_packages`: Available purchase packages
- `subscription_credits`: Subscription-based credit allocations

### Frontend Components
- Credit balance display
- Purchase interfaces
- Usage tracking
- Admin panels

## üîê Security Considerations

- **Server-side validation**: All credit operations are validated server-side
- **Transaction integrity**: Database transactions ensure consistency
- **Rate limiting**: Prevents abuse of credit-consuming endpoints
- **Audit trails**: Complete transaction history for accountability

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

- **Real-time balance tracking**: Instant updates across all components
- **Usage analytics**: Track consumption patterns
- **Revenue reporting**: Monitor credit purchases and subscriptions
- **Performance metrics**: System health and response times

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

The credit system is designed to be highly customizable:

- **Flexible pricing**: Configure credit costs per feature
- **Custom packages**: Create tailored credit bundles
- **Subscription integration**: Combine with recurring billing
- **Multi-tier access**: Implement different user levels

## üÜò Support & Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the [Troubleshooting Guide](./CREDIT_SYSTEM.md#troubleshooting)
2. Review [Common Issues](./CREDIT_UTILITIES.md#troubleshooting)
3. Verify your [Configuration](./CREDIT_UTILITIES.md#environment-variables)
4. Test with [Testing Utilities](./CREDIT_UTILITIES.md#testing-utilities)

## üìù Contributing

When extending the credit system:

- Follow the established patterns in the integration guide
- Maintain transaction integrity
- Add appropriate error handling
- Update documentation for new features
- Test thoroughly with the provided utilities

## üîÑ Migration & Updates

For existing applications:

- Review the [Migration Guide](./CREDIT_SYSTEM.md#migration-guide)
- Follow [Best Practices](./CREDIT_SYSTEM.md#best-practices)
- Test in staging environment first
- Plan for zero-downtime deployment
